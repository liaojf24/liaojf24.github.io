I'm Jiafeng Liao, a highly self-motivated student preparing to apply for a PhD. I pride myself on my exceptional execution skills, my commitment to each project, and the sincerity towards friends.   
\\
I'm currently interested in bioinformatics, deep learning, and AI applications in proteomics and genomics.   
\\
I obtained a Bachelor's degree of Engineering in Bioinformatics from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2021, where I was awarded "Outstanding Undergraduate in Academics (top 1%)". Subsequently, I pursued further studies at the School of Future Technology at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, receiving rigorous training in both deep learning and biology within an interdisciplinary setting.    
\\
Currently, I am seeking remote research internships in bioinformatics and preparing for my English proficiency tests. I am eager to connect with anyone who can offer opportunities for conducting research in bioinformatics, share their PhD application experiences, or exchange intriguing ideas. I am always ready to listen and learn. Feel free to contact me via email and my [wechat](../images/Wechatljf.jpeg) if you want any relevant discussions.
