I'm Jiafeng Liao, a self-motivated student who is preparing to apply for PhD. \\
I'm currently interested in bioinformatics, deep learning, AI for Science,like proteomics,genomics.\\
I obtained my bachelor's degree in Engineering of Bioinformatics from Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST),WuHan, China in 2021. And I was awarded the "Outstanding Undergraduate In Terms of Academics(top 1%) in HUST. After that, I studied in School of Future Technology, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. I've accepted a comprehensive training in an interdisciplinary field, Dl and biology. I have exceptional execution skills and take every task seriously.Now, I'm in a gap period and preparing to apply for the 2025 fall PhD. \\
I'm searching for remote research interns in bioinformatics and preparing for English test. So I'm very pleased and grateful that anyone can contact me for research interns in bioinformatics, communicating PhD application experience, or sharing something interesting with me. I'd like to be a good listener.
